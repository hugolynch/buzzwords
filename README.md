### Rules

In Buzzwords, the goal is to score as many points as possible by creating valid words using a set of 7 provided letters.

One of these letters is highlighted and must be included in every word you form. The remaining 6 letters are optional and can be used as many times as youâ€™d like, or not at all. Words must be at least 4 letters long.

Words are scored based on their length, with 1 point awarded for each letter, except for 4-letter words, which are only worth 1 point total. Additionally, if you create a word that uses all 7 letters at least once (called a "Buzzword"), you earn an extra 7 bonus points on top of the base score. For example, an 8-letter Buzzword would be worth 8 points plus 7 bonus points, totalling 15 points.
